# Cluster Simulation

This guide covers running multi-instance BLIS simulations — the full pipeline from request arrival through admission, routing, scheduling, and metrics aggregation.

```bash
# Quick example: 4-instance cluster with tracing
./blis run --model meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500 \
  --trace-level decisions --summarize-trace
```

## Single-Instance vs Cluster Mode

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `--num-instances 1` (default) | Single-instance: requests go directly to the wait queue, no admission or routing |
| `--num-instances N` (N > 1) | Cluster mode: requests pass through admission → routing → per-instance queues |

## The Pipeline

```
Request → Admission → Routing → Instance WaitQueue → Batch Formation → Step → Completion
                                                          ↓
                                                    KV Allocation + Latency Estimation
```

Each stage is configurable:

| Stage | Controls | Key Flags |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Admission** | Whether to accept the request | `--admission-policy`, `--token-bucket-capacity` |
| **Routing** | Which instance receives it | `--routing-policy`, `--routing-scorers` |
| **Scheduling** | What order within the instance | `--scheduler`, `--priority-policy` |
| **Batch Formation** | Which requests form the next batch | `--max-num-running-reqs`, `--max-num-scheduled-tokens` |

## Tensor Parallelism

The `--tp` flag sets the tensor parallelism degree for all instances. TP affects both latency (FLOPs split across GPUs) and memory (KV blocks split across GPUs):

```bash
# TP=2: 2 GPUs per instance
./blis run --model meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  --num-instances 4 --tp 2 --rate 100 --num-requests 500

# TP=4: 4 GPUs per instance (lower latency, fewer KV blocks per GPU)
./blis run --model meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  --num-instances 2 --tp 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```

!!! note "Homogeneous instances"
    All instances share the same SimConfig (model, GPU, TP, KV blocks). BLIS does not currently model heterogeneous fleets (mixed GPU types or TP configurations).

## Scaling and Saturation

Instance scaling produces **super-linear** TTFT improvement near saturation. Doubling from 4→8 instances at near-capacity (rate=500) improves TTFT p99 by 7.4x, not 2x.

This happens because the per-instance queue growth rate `excess = λ/k - μ` drops faster than linearly:

```
4 instances: excess = 500/4 - 57.4 = 67.6 req/s per instance → rapid queue growth
8 instances: excess = 500/8 - 57.4 = 5.1 req/s per instance  → minimal queueing
```

At sub-saturation (rate=100): scaling effect vanishes (1.06x).

## Admission Control

For rate-limiting and traffic shaping policies, see the [Admission Control](admission.md) page.

## Admission and Routing Latency

Model real network/processing overhead between gateway and backend:

```bash
--admission-latency 1000   # 1ms admission decision overhead
--routing-latency 500      # 0.5ms routing decision overhead
```

These add simulated delays to the admission and routing pipeline, modeling gRPC overhead, service mesh hops, and queue serialization in production deployments.

## Decision Tracing

Log every routing decision for offline analysis:

```bash
./blis run --model meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500 \
  --trace-level decisions --summarize-trace --counterfactual-k 3
```

The trace summary shows:
- **Target Distribution** — how many requests went to each instance
- **Mean/Max Regret** — how much better an alternative routing decision could have been

!!! info "Counterfactual regret for weighted policies"
    For score-based policies (weighted, least-loaded), counterfactual regret is **structurally zero** — the chosen instance is always the highest-scoring one. Regret is only meaningful for non-score-based policies like round-robin.

## Event Ordering

The cluster uses `(timestamp, priority, seqID)` ordering for deterministic event processing:

- Cluster events at time T process before instance events at time T
- Same-time instance ties broken by lowest instance index
- This ensures determinism (INV-6) but means results differ from a simple M/M/k queueing model

## Work-Conserving Property

BLIS is work-conserving (INV-8): it never idles while requests wait. After every step completion, if the WaitQ has requests, a new StepEvent is immediately scheduled. Real systems may have scheduling delays not modeled here.

## PD Disaggregation

BLIS supports optional prefill-decode disaggregation: partitioning the cluster into dedicated prefill instances (which process the input prompt) and decode instances (which generate output tokens). This models architectures like [Mooncake](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00079) and Splitwise that separate these two workload phases.

### Enabling Disaggregation

```bash
./blis run --model meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  --num-instances 4 \
  --prefill-instances 2 \
  --decode-instances 2 \
  --pd-decider always
```

### Pool Topology Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Both or neither | `--prefill-instances` and `--decode-instances` must both be set or both omitted. |
| Sum constraint | `prefill + decode ≤ num-instances`. |
| Instance assignment | Instances `0..prefill-1` → prefill pool; `prefill..prefill+decode-1` → decode pool. |
| Unassigned instances | If `prefill + decode < num-instances`, remaining instances are unassigned and receive requests via the standard routing policy. |

### Disaggregation Deciders

| Name | Behavior |
|------|---------|
| `never` (default) | Never disaggregate — all requests go through standard routing. |
| `always` | Always disaggregate — marks every request for disaggregated routing. |

Custom deciders implement `sim.DisaggregationDecider`. See [Extension Recipes](../contributing/extension-recipes.md#adding-new-disaggregation-deciders).

### Current Limitations (PR1 Scaffolding)

The disaggregation pipeline is available but pool-aware routing is not yet implemented. Both `disaggregate=true` and `disaggregate=false` currently lead to the same (pool-unfiltered) routing policy. Enabling disaggregation has zero effect on simulation outcomes until pool-aware routing is implemented in a subsequent PR. Use this configuration to validate topology constraints and pipeline wiring.

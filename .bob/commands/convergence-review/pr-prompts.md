# PR Review Perspective Prompts

Reference file for the convergence-review skill. Contains exact prompts for the 20 PR review perspectives across plan review and code review gates.

**Canonical source:** `docs/contributing/pr-workflow.md` (v4.0). After the human-first rewrite, pr-workflow.md contains the same checklist content in human-readable format; this file preserves the agent dispatch format. Content is aligned; format differs intentionally. If checklist *content* diverges, pr-workflow.md is authoritative.

**Dispatch pattern:** Launch each perspective as a parallel Task agent:
```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model=REVIEW_MODEL, run_in_background=True,
     prompt="<prompt from below>\n\n<artifact content>")
```
Model selection is controlled by the `--model` flag in the convergence-review skill (default: `haiku`).

## Section A: PR Plan Review (10 perspectives) — Step 2.5

### PP-1: Substance & Design

```
Review this implementation plan for substance: Are the behavioral contracts logically sound? Are there mathematical errors, scale mismatches, or unit confusions? Could the design actually achieve what the contracts promise? Check formulas, thresholds, and edge cases from first principles — not just structural completeness.

PLAN CONTENTS:
<paste plan file>

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### PP-2: Cross-Document Consistency

```
Does this micro plan's scope match the source document? Are file paths consistent with the actual codebase? Does the deviation log account for all differences between what the source says and what the micro plan does? Check for stale references to completed PRs or removed files.

PLAN CONTENTS:
<paste plan file>

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### PP-3: Architecture Boundary Verification

```
Does this plan maintain architectural boundaries? Check:
(1) Individual instances don't access cluster-level state
(2) Types are in the right packages (sim/ vs sim/cluster/ vs cmd/)
(3) No import cycles introduced
(4) Does the plan introduce multiple construction sites for the same type?
(5) Does adding one field to a new type require >3 files?
(6) Does library code (sim/) call logrus.Fatalf anywhere in new code?
(7) Dependency direction: cmd/ → sim/cluster/ → sim/ (never reversed)

Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### PP-4: Codebase Readiness

```
We're about to implement this PR. Review the codebase for readiness. Check each file the plan will modify for:
- Stale comments ("planned for PR N" where N is completed)
- Pre-existing bugs that would complicate implementation
- Missing dependencies
- Unclear insertion points
- TODO/FIXME items in the modification zone

Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### PP-5: Structural Validation (perform directly, no agent)

> **For Claude:** Perform these 4 checks directly. Do NOT dispatch an agent.

**Check 1 — Task Dependencies:**
For each task, verify it can actually start given what comes before it. Trace the dependency chain: what files does each task create/modify? Does any task require a file or type that hasn't been created yet?

**Check 2 — Template Completeness:**
Verify all sections from `docs/contributing/templates/micro-plan-prompt.md` are present and non-empty: Header, Part 1 (A-E), Part 2 (F-I), Part 3 (J), Appendix.

**Check 3 — Executive Summary Clarity:**
Read the executive summary as if you're a new team member. Is the scope clear without reading the rest?

**Check 4 — Under-specified Tasks:**
For each task, verify it has complete code. Flag any step an executing agent would need to figure out on its own.

### PP-6: DES Expert

```
Review this plan as a discrete-event simulation expert. Check for:
- Event ordering bugs in the proposed design
- Clock monotonicity violations (INV-3)
- Stale signal propagation between event types (INV-7)

- Event-driven race conditions
- Work-conserving property violations (INV-8)
- Incorrect assumptions about DES event processing semantics

- Algorithmic complexity issues (O(n^2) where O(n) suffices)
- Unnecessary allocations in hot paths (event loop, batch formation)
- Map iteration in O(n) loops that could grow
- Benchmark-sensitive changes

- Panic paths reachable from user input (R3, R6)
- Resource exhaustion vectors (unbounded loops, unlimited memory growth) (R19)
- Degenerate input handling (empty, zero, negative, NaN, Inf) (R3, R20)

## Section B: PR Code Review (10 perspectives) — Step 4.5

### PC-1: Substance & Design

```
Review this diff for substance: Are there logic bugs, design mismatches between contracts and implementation, mathematical errors, or silent regressions? Check from first principles — not just structural patterns. Does the implementation actually achieve what the behavioral contracts promise?

DIFF:
<paste git diff output>

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### PC-2: Code Quality + Antipattern Check

```
Review this diff for code quality. Check all of these:
(1) Any new error paths that use `continue` or early `return` — do they clean up partial state? (R1, R5)
(2) Any map iteration that accumulates floats — are keys sorted? (R2)
(3) Any struct field added — are all construction sites updated? (R4)
(4) Does library code (sim/) call logrus.Fatalf anywhere in new code? (R6)
(5) Any exported mutable maps — should they be unexported with IsValid*() accessors? (R8)
(6) Any YAML config fields using float64 instead of *float64 where zero is valid? (R9)
(7) Any division where the denominator derives from runtime state without a zero guard? (R11)
(8) Any new interface with methods only meaningful for one implementation? (R13)
(9) Any method >50 lines spanning multiple concerns (scheduling + latency + metrics)? (R14)
(10) Any changes to docs/contributing/standards/ files — are CLAUDE.md working copies updated? (DRY)

DIFF:
<paste git diff output>

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### PC-3: Test Behavioral Quality

```
Review the tests in this diff. For each test, rate as Behavioral, Mixed, or Structural:
- Behavioral: tests observable behavior (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN), survives refactoring
- Mixed: some behavioral assertions, some structural coupling
- Structural: asserts internal structure (field access, type assertions), breaks on refactor

Also check:
- Are there golden dataset tests that lack companion invariant tests? (R7)
- Do tests verify laws (conservation, monotonicity, causality) not just values?
- Would each test still pass if the implementation were completely rewritten?

### PC-4: Getting-Started Experience

```
Review this diff for user and contributor experience. Simulate both journeys:
(1) A user doing capacity planning with the CLI — would they find everything they need?
(2) A contributor adding a new algorithm — would they know how to extend this?

Check:
- Missing example files or CLI documentation
- Undocumented output metrics
- Incomplete contributor guide updates
- Unclear extension points
- README not updated for new features

### PC-5: Automated Reviewer Simulation

```
The upstream community uses GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Codex to review PRs. Do a rigorous check so this will pass their review. Look for:
- Exported mutable globals
- User-controlled panic paths
- YAML typo acceptance (should use KnownFields(true))
- NaN/Inf validation gaps
- Redundant or dead code
- Style inconsistencies
- Missing error returns

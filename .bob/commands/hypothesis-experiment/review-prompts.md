# Review Agent Dispatch Prompts

Reference file for the hypothesis-experiment skill. Contains exact prompts for all 20 reviewer perspectives across the three review gates.

**Canonical source:** `docs/contributing/hypothesis.md` (v2.0). If prompts here diverge from hypothesis.md, the process doc is authoritative.

**Usage**: Launch each perspective as a parallel Task agent:
```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model=REVIEW_MODEL, run_in_background=True,
     prompt="<prompt from below>")
```
Model selection is controlled by the `--model` flag in the convergence-review skill (default: `haiku`).

**After all agents complete**: Read each output file independently. Count CRITICAL and IMPORTANT findings yourself. Do NOT trust agent-reported totals.

## Section A: Design Review (5 perspectives) — Step 2

### DR-1: Hypothesis Quality

```
You are reviewing a hypothesis experiment design for the BLIS discrete-event simulator.

HYPOTHESIS AND DESIGN:
<paste hypothesis sentence, classification, experiment design>

YOUR FOCUS: Hypothesis Quality
- Is the hypothesis behavioral, testable, and diagnostic?
- Does it follow the family-specific sentence pattern from docs/contributing/standards/experiments.md?
- Is the diagnostic clause present ("If this fails, it would indicate...")?
- Is it correctly classified (family, VV&UQ category, type)?
- Is the hypothesis conceptual (not code-grounded)? It should NOT reference specific files/lines.

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### DR-2: Experiment Design Rigor (ED-1–ED-6)

```
You are reviewing a hypothesis experiment design for the BLIS discrete-event simulator.

HYPOTHESIS AND DESIGN:
<paste hypothesis sentence, classification, experiment design>

YOUR FOCUS: Experiment Design Rigor
Check compliance with each standard:
- ED-1: Is exactly ONE dimension varied between configurations? Everything else constant?
- ED-2: Is there a rate where the effect should vanish, to confirm mechanism dependence?
- ED-3: Are preconditions verified in the script (not just prose)?
- ED-4: Is seed handling correct? (3+ seeds for statistical: 42, 123, 456)
- ED-5: Is the experiment reproducible from run.sh alone?
- ED-6: If reusing calibration from a prior experiment, is the config diff documented?

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### DR-3: Parameter Calibration

```
You are reviewing a hypothesis experiment design for the BLIS discrete-event simulator.

HYPOTHESIS AND DESIGN:
<paste hypothesis sentence, classification, experiment design>

YOUR FOCUS: Parameter Calibration
- Are parameters computed analytically from known coefficients, not guessed?
  - Beta coefficients (llama-3.1-8b, H100, TP=2): [6910.42, 17.67, 2.84]
    stepTime = 6910.42 + 17.67*cacheMissTokens + 2.84*decodeTokens (microseconds)
  - Alpha coefficients: [1601.35, 3.51, 1805.54]
    queueDelay = 1601.35 + 3.51*inputLen; outputProcessing = 1805.54 (microseconds)
- Are capacity estimates matched to the actual workload mode?
  - CLI mode (--rate): uses defaults prompt=512, output=512 -> step ~17.4ms, capacity ~57.4 req/s
  - Workload-spec YAML: uses distributions defined in the YAML (compute step time from YAML params)
- Is the operating point correct? (near saturation for queueing effects, sub-saturation for baseline)
- Is --total-kv-blocks appropriate? (CLI default is overridden by defaults.yaml to 132139 for llama/H100/TP=2)

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### DR-4: Control Completeness

```
You are reviewing a hypothesis experiment design for the BLIS discrete-event simulator.

HYPOTHESIS AND DESIGN:
<paste hypothesis sentence, classification, experiment design>

YOUR FOCUS: Control Completeness
- Does every proposed mechanism have a planned control experiment? (RCV-4)
- Does each control isolate exactly one variable?
- Is the baseline configuration clearly defined?
- Are there confounding variables that could explain results without the proposed mechanism?

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### DR-5: DES and Domain Fit

```
You are reviewing a hypothesis experiment design for the BLIS discrete-event simulator.

HYPOTHESIS AND DESIGN:
<paste hypothesis sentence, classification, experiment design>

YOUR FOCUS: DES and Domain Fit
- Will the experiment create the conditions needed for the hypothesis to be testable?
- Are there DES-specific subtleties that could confound results?
  - Alpha overhead (~4.3ms/req) is non-blocking but inflates E2E metrics
  - Step quantization: step time is per-batch, not per-request
  - Clock granularity: microsecond ticks
  - Event ordering: (timestamp, priority, seqID) at cluster level
- Is the experiment duration sufficient? Request count adequate for the intended effect?
- Is the warmup period adequate (or does the experiment need cold-start behavior)?

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

## Section B: Code Review (5 perspectives) — Step 5

### CR-1: Parser–Output Format Agreement

```
You are code-reviewing a BLIS hypothesis experiment BEFORE it runs.

FILES TO REVIEW:
<paste or reference run.sh and analyze.py paths>

YOUR FOCUS: Parser–Output Format Agreement
For every regex or field extraction in analyze.py, verify the pattern matches actual output:
- Read cmd/root.go — what text does the CLI print? (format strings for "Preemption Rate: %.4f", etc.)
- Read sim/metrics_utils.go — what JSON fields exist in MetricsOutput?
- Match every regex in analyze.py against the format string in the producer code
- SILENT DEFAULTS: verify that when a regex matches nothing, analyze.py warns to stderr rather than silently defaulting to 0
- Check parse_blis_output() from hypotheses/lib/analyze_helpers.py — does it extract what this experiment needs? (NOTE: it does NOT extract dropped_unservable)

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### CR-2: CLI Flag Correctness

```
You are code-reviewing a BLIS hypothesis experiment BEFORE it runs.

FILES TO REVIEW:
<paste or reference run.sh path>

YOUR FOCUS: CLI Flag Correctness
For every flag in run.sh:
- Verify the flag name exists in cmd/root.go
- Verify the value type matches (string, int, float)
- Check for typos that strict YAML parsing would reject
- Verify --stderr comes BEFORE other flags in blis_run calls (harness checks position 3 only)
- Cross-reference blis_run timeout tiers: TIMEOUT_QUICK (<100 req), TIMEOUT_STANDARD (100-500), TIMEOUT_EXTENDED (>500)

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### CR-3: YAML Field Validation

```
You are code-reviewing a BLIS hypothesis experiment BEFORE it runs.

FILES TO REVIEW:
<paste or reference run.sh and any .yaml files>

YOUR FOCUS: YAML Field Validation
If the experiment uses workload-spec YAML files:
- Verify field names against sim/workload/spec.go struct tags
- Key gotchas: `id:` not `client_id:`, `process:` not `type:` in arrival, `aggregate_rate:` top-level, `rate_fraction:` per client, distribution params under `params:` with `std_dev` not `stdev`, `prefix_group`+`prefix_length` not `prefix_tokens`
- KnownFields(true) will reject typos at runtime — catching them now saves a failed run
- If YAML is generated inline in run.sh (heredoc), verify the heredoc syntax is correct

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### CR-4: Config Diff (ED-6)

```
You are code-reviewing a BLIS hypothesis experiment BEFORE it runs.

FILES TO REVIEW:
<paste or reference run.sh path>

YOUR FOCUS: Config Diff (ED-6)
- If the experiment reuses calibration from a prior experiment, diff every CLI flag and YAML field between the two
- Explicitly list all differences
- Verify the # Reference: comment in run.sh points to the correct file
- Check: does any changed flag (routing policy, seed, rate, blocks) invalidate the calibration?
- Evidence: H10 used --routing-policy least-loaded while H8 used round-robin, shifting the preemption cliff. Caught only in post-publication review.

If no prior experiment is referenced, report "N/A — no referenced experiment" and move on.

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.
```

### CR-5: Seed and Determinism

```
You are code-reviewing a BLIS hypothesis experiment BEFORE it runs.

FILES TO REVIEW:
<paste or reference run.sh path>

YOUR FOCUS: Seed and Determinism
- Verify --seed is passed correctly in every blis_run call
- Verify workload YAML seed: field doesn't conflict with --seed (CLI overrides YAML when explicit)
- Verify seeds vary across runs as intended (ED-4)
- Check that run.sh builds the binary (setup_experiment) and is fully self-contained (ED-5)
- Verify run.sh sources hypotheses/lib/harness.sh
- Verify every blis_run call has a timeout tier (no bare $BINARY run calls)

Rate each finding as CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION.
Report: (1) numbered list of findings with severity, (2) total CRITICAL count, (3) total IMPORTANT count.

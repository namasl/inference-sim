	//     recordRequestCompletion (issue #846). For roofline (overhead=0), equals
	//     the raw cluster clock tick.
	//   - Dropped at transfer start (issue #1343): set to KVTransferStartedEvent
	//     time when ReserveTransferredKV fails or the decode pod is non-routable.
	//     Signature: TransferStartTime > 0 && CompletionTime == TransferStartTime
	//     && TransferCompleteTime == 0. No KVTransferCompletedEvent is scheduled.
	//   - Dropped at transfer complete: set to KVTransferCompletedEvent time when
	//     the decode pod transitioned non-routable during the transfer window.
	//     Reserved KV is released before the drop. Signature:
	//     TransferCompleteTime > 0 && DecodeSubReq == nil.

	//     timeout detection time. The session is cancelled via sessionCallback.
